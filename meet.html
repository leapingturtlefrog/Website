Hi there!

Seems like you made it into the wacky realm of code... something I like too!

Which is another reason why you should simply press on that email button
and send even a few short lines :)

Trust me, I've sent worse. Like that time I sent somebody an email asking if
they'd resigned so I could make some profit off of it (they never replied).
But we can talk about that later.

Right now, I'm worrying about what it takes to be a one-in-a-hundred-trillion
person.

ᓚᘏᗢ Yep.
