Hi there!

Seems like you made it into the wacky realm of code... something I like too!

Which is another reason why you should simply press on that email button
and send even a few short lines :)

Trust me, I've sent worse. Like that time I sent somebody an email asking if
they'd resigned so I could make some profit off of it (they never replied).
But we can talk about that later.

Right now, I'm worrying about what it takes to be a one-in-a-hundred-trillion
person.

ᓚᘏᗢ Yep.

~ Alex Aridgides, from the future.

        <h4><em>Builder of things. Breaker of limits.</em></h4>
        <br>
        <p><strong>I’m here to make big things happen.</strong>
            <br><br>
            What does that mean, exactly?
            <br><br>
            It means I’m relentlessly driven—driven to work harder, make a difference, and change the world.
            <br><br>
            Scratch that. Let's change the entire <em>universe</em>. Nothing less.
            <br><br>
            I pursue this goal with inexhaustible curiosity, a commitment to learning, collaboration, and a strong desire to help others.
            <br><br>
            As a kid, my favorite color was “the rainbow” because I refused to only pick one color. I approach problems the same way—by being the hardest-working problem solver who <em>delves in</em> to understand every aspect and angle.
            <br><br>
            Of the 2.8 million high school students who take Advanced Placement exams, I ranked in the top 0.002%. (Except for Music Theory—I’m still working on that one.)
            <br><br>
            At the same time, I led two robotics teams to the US Regionals and mentored a third—the youngest team in the state—from last place to second place in just one year.
            <br><br>
            Have I had failures? Absolutely. Have I learned from them? Even more so.
            <br><br>
	          A friend and I built an autonomous robot over the summer—then discovered the vision model broke under sunlight. We reworked the whole stack. Lesson learned: tech that doesn’t survive the real world is just a toy.
            <br><br>
	          I spent 3 days solo-building a backend beast of an app. I thought I’d nailed it. I lost to a simpler app that <em>looked</em> better. That’s when I realized: users don’t care how hard it was to build—only how intuitive it feels, and, a bit later, if it actually adds value to them.
            <br><br>
            I’m still working out the best way to change the universe, but what I at least know is that if you’re reading this, reach out. If you’re passionate about making an impact, going when others would stop, driving through challenges unwaveringly—maybe even pushing a car when it won’t go any farther (I may have done this once), again, reach out.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Together, <em>let’s make big things happen.</em></strong>
            <br><br>
