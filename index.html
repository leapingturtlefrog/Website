Hi there!

Seems like you made it into the wacky realm of code... something I like too!

Which is another reason why you should simply press on that email button
and send even a few short lines :)

Trust me, I've sent worse. Like that time I sent somebody an email asking if
they'd resigned so I could make some profit off of it (they never replied).
But we can talk about that later.

Right now, I'm worrying about what it takes to be a one-in-a-hundred-trillion
person.

ᓚᘏᗢ Yep.

    <h4>(With some words and links and not much else right now)</h4>
    <br>
    <p><strong>I aim to make big things happen.</strong>
        <br><br>
        What does that mean, exactly?
        <br><br>
        It means I’m relentlessly driven—driven to work harder, make a difference, and change the world.
        <br><br>
        And I’m serious about that last part.
        <br><br>
        I want to change the world. Actually, let’s aim higher—the entire <em>cosmos</em>. Nothing less.
        <br><br>
        I pursue this goal with inexhaustible curiosity, a commitment to learning, collaboration, and a strong desire to help others.
        <br><br>
        As a kid, my favorite color was “the rainbow” because I refused to pick just one. I approach problems the same way—not by being the best expert in the room, but by being the hardest working problem solver who <em>delves in</em> to understand every aspect and angle.
        <br><br>
        Of the 2.8 million high school students who take Advanced Placement exams, I ranked in the top 0.002%. (Except for Music Theory—I’m still working on that one.)
        <br><br>
        At the same time, I led two robotics teams to the US Regionals and mentored a third—the youngest team in the state—from last place to second in just one year.
        <br><br>
        Have I had failures? Absolutely. Have I learned from them? Even more so.
        <br><br>
        A friend and I spent an entire summer building an autonomous robot. Then, one afternoon, when we took the robot outside—where it was supposed to function—it failed completely. The cameras, sensors, and object detection model were all fully incompatible with the bright sunlight. We ended up redoing half the project. Lesson learned.
        <br><br>
        In a solo hackathon, I poured days into making the most complex app with all the functionality I could imagine and the most to handle behind the scenes. I thought I’d nailed it.
        <br><br>
        Then I didn’t win. I didn’t even make it into the top three. Why? The problem was that despite all my backend effort, my app simply lacked visual appeal and flow. In short, it wasn’t <em>beautiful and intuitive</em>. The winning apps weren’t the most complex; they were the ones that looked the best and most user-friendly. Another lesson learned.
        <br><br>
        I’m still working out the best way to change the cosmos, but what I at least know is that if you’re reading this, reach out. If you’re passionate about making an impact, going when others would stop, driving through challenges unwaveringly—maybe even pushing a car when it won’t go any farther (I may have done this once), again, reach out.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Together, let’s make big things happen.</strong>
        <br><br>
